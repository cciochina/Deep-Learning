# Deep-Learning
Optimization:
    I tried to finish the optimization step by I was running out of ram memory on google colab, to prove that in the output folder
    I have put a screenshot with my google drive page where you can see that I don't have any memory. I am sorry that I couldn't figure how to do the changes without running out
    of ram.


Report:

Overview: 
My goal is to predict if the applicants for funding will be successful or not.. I used binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Results:
What I did:
-	I Droped the non-beneficial ID columns, 'EIN' and 'NAME'.
-	I  Determined  the number of unique values in each column
-	I Looked at application type value counts for binning
-	I created a list of application types to be replaced and checked if binning was successful
-	I Looked at classification type value counts for binning
-	I created a list of classification to be replaced and checked if binning was successful
-	I converted categorical data to numeric
-	I created testing data and training data for our analysis 
-	The final action was to Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
The overall results are indicating that the accuracy is 73%.
Unfortunate I couldnâ€™t increase model performance because I had issues with ram memory on my google drive.

Summary:
For this model the accuracy is 73%, so my conclusion is that the applicants will be not successful funded by Alphabet Soup.
